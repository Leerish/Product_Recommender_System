Recommender Systems are algorithms that suggest relevant options to users based on multiple parameters: the user’s browsing and purchase history or just user’s data. These algorithms deal with vast amounts of personal data and most users are unaware of how much of their personal data is used by these algorithms and how securely their data is being used to provide them a better browsing experience. Therefore, a need arises to ensure privacy of the users while using their data in the recommender system algorithms. This project focuses on implementing the privacy-preserving framework with text data for cross-domain recommendation, that is, it aims to preserve privacy of data that combines text with imaging data in a recommender system that uses data to recommend items from multiple similar domains.
